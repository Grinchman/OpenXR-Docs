==== Overview

This extension allows an application to enable support for one or more
**secondary view configurations**.
A secondary view configuration is a well-known set of views that the runtime
can make active while a session is running.
In a frame where a secondary view configuration is active, the application's
single frame loop should additionally render into those active secondary
views, sharing the frame waiting logic and update loop with the primary view
configuration for that running session.

A proper secondary view configuration support includes following steps:

1. When calling flink:xrCreateInstance, enable the
   <<XR_MSFT_secondary_view_configuration>> extension and the extension
   defines a concrete secondary view configuration type, for example,
   <<XR_MSFT_first_person_observer>>.

2. Inspect supported secondary view configurations using the
   flink:xrEnumerateViewConfigurations function.

3. Enable supported secondary view configurations using the
   flink:xrBeginSession function with an
   slink:XrSecondaryViewConfigurationSessionBeginInfoMSFT chained extension
   structure.

4. Inspect if an enabled secondary view configuration is activated by the
   system or the user using the flink:xrWaitFrame function with an
   slink:XrSecondaryViewConfigurationFrameStateMSFT chained extension
   structure.

5. When a secondary view configuration is changed to active, get the latest
   view configuration properties using the
   flink:xrGetViewConfigurationProperties and
   flink:xrEnumerateViewConfigurationViews functions.

6. Create the swapchain images for the active secondary view configuration
   using the flink:xrCreateSwapchain function with an
   slink:XrSecondaryViewConfigurationSwapchainCreateInfoMSFT chained
   extension structure using pname:recommendedImageRectWidth and
   pname:recommendedImageRectHeight in the corresponding
   slink:XrViewConfigurationView structure returned from
   flink:xrEnumerateViewConfigurationViews.

7. Locate the secondary view configuration views using the
   flink:xrLocateViews function with the active secondary view configuration
   type.

8. Submit the composition layers using the swapchain images for an active
   secondary view configuration using the flink:xrEndFrame function with the
   slink:XrSecondaryViewConfigurationFrameEndInfoMSFT chained extension
   structure.

==== Enumerate supported secondary view configurations

The first step is for the application to inspect if a runtime supports
certain secondary view configurations.
The app uses the existing API flink:xrEnumerateViewConfigurations for this.

For example, when the <<XR_MSFT_first_person_observer>> extension is
enabled, the application will enumerate a view configuration of type
ename:XR_VIEW_CONFIGURATION_TYPE_SECONDARY_MONO_FIRST_PERSON_OBSERVER_MSFT,
and can use this secondary view configuration type in later functions.

==== Secondary view configuration properties

The application can inspect the properties of a secondary view configuration
through the existing flink:xrGetViewConfigurationProperties,
flink:xrEnumerateViewConfigurationViews and
flink:xrEnumerateEnvironmentBlendModes functions using a supported secondary
view configuration type.

The runtime may: change the recommended properties, such as recommended
image width or height, when the secondary view configuration becomes active.
The application should: use the latest recommended width and height when
creating swapchain images and related resources for the active secondary
view configuration.

[open,refpage='XrSecondaryViewConfigurationSwapchainCreateInfoMSFT',desc='Hint to runtime that the created swapchain image will be used for given secondary view configuration.',type='structs',xrefs='XrSwapchainCreateInfo']
--
When an application creates swapchain images for a secondary view
configuration, it can: chain a
slink:XrSecondaryViewConfigurationSwapchainCreateInfoMSFT structure to
slink:XrSwapchainCreateInfo when calling flink:xrCreateSwapchain.
This hints to the runtime that the created swapchain image will be submitted
to the given secondary view configuration, allowing the runtime to make
optimizations for such usage when there is opportunity.

.Member Descriptions
****
* pname:type is the elink:XrStructureType of this structure.
* pname:next is code:NULL or a pointer to the next structure in a structure
  chain.
  No such structures are defined in core OpenXR or this extension.
* pname:viewConfigurationType is the secondary view configuration type the
  application is intending to use this swapchain for.
****

If this structure is not present in the slink:XrSwapchainCreateInfo next
chain when calling flink:xrCreateSwapchain, the runtime should: optimize the
created swapchain for the primary view configuration of the session.

If the application submits a swapchain image created with one view
configuration type to a composition layer for another view configuration,
the runtime may: need to copy the resource across view configurations.
However, the runtime must: correctly compose the image regardless which view
configuration type was hinted when swapchain image was created.

include::../../../../generated/validity/structs/XrSecondaryViewConfigurationSwapchainCreateInfoMSFT.txt[]
--

==== Enable secondary view configuration

The application indicates to the runtime which secondary view configurations
it can support by chaining an
slink:XrSecondaryViewConfigurationSessionBeginInfoMSFT structure to the
slink:XrSessionBeginInfo::pname:next pointer when calling
flink:xrBeginSession.

[open,refpage='XrSecondaryViewConfigurationSessionBeginInfoMSFT',desc='Describes an extension structure to flink:xrBeginSession indicating supported view configuration types.',type='structs',xrefs='XrSessionBeginInfo']
--
The slink:XrSecondaryViewConfigurationSessionBeginInfoMSFT structure is used
by the application to indicate the list of secondary
elink:XrViewConfigurationType to enable for this session.

It is defined as:

include::../../../../generated/api/structs/XrSecondaryViewConfigurationSessionBeginInfoMSFT.txt[]

.Member Descriptions
****
* pname:type is the elink:XrStructureType of this structure.
* pname:next is code:NULL or a pointer to the next structure in a structure
  chain.
  No such structures are defined in core OpenXR or this extension.
* pname:viewConfigurationCount is the number of elements in
  pname:enabledViewConfigurationTypes
* pname:enabledViewConfigurationTypes is an array of enabled secondary view
  configuration types that application supports.
****

If there are any duplicated view configuration types in the array of
pname:enabledViewConfigurationTypes, the runtime must: return error
ename:XR_ERROR_VALIDATION_FAILURE.

If there are any primary view configuration types in the array of
pname:enabledViewConfigurationTypes, the runtime must: return error
ename:XR_ERROR_VALIDATION_FAILURE.

If there are any secondary view configuration types not returned by
flink:xrEnumerateViewConfigurations in the array of
pname:enabledViewConfigurationTypes, the runtime must: return error
ename:XR_ERROR_VIEW_CONFIGURATION_TYPE_UNSUPPORTED.

include::../../../../generated/validity/structs/XrSecondaryViewConfigurationSessionBeginInfoMSFT.txt[]
--

==== Per-frame active view configurations

The runtime then tells the application at each flink:xrWaitFrame function
call which of the enabled secondary view configurations are active for that
frame.
When extension structure slink:XrSecondaryViewConfigurationFrameStateMSFT is
chained to the slink:XrFrameState::next pointer, the runtime writes into
this structure the state of each enabled secondary view configuration.

[open,refpage='XrSecondaryViewConfigurationFrameStateMSFT',desc='Extension structure to xrWaitFrame to return a list of secondary view configuration states.',type='structs',xrefs='XrFrameState']
--
The slink:XrSecondaryViewConfigurationFrameStateMSFT structure returns
whether the enabled view configurations are active or inactive.

It is defined as as:

include::../../../../generated/api/structs/XrSecondaryViewConfigurationFrameStateMSFT.txt[]

.Member Descriptions
****
* pname:type is the elink:XrStructureType of this structure.
* pname:next is code:NULL or a pointer to the next structure in a structure

* pname:viewConfigurationCount is the number of elements in
  pname:viewConfigurationStates.
* pname:viewConfigurationStates is an array of
  slink:XrSecondaryViewConfigurationStateMSFT structures.
****

The array size pname:viewConfigurationCount in the
slink:XrSecondaryViewConfigurationFrameStateMSFT structure must: be the same
as the array size enabled through
slink:XrSecondaryViewConfigurationSessionBeginInfoMSFT when calling
flink:xrBeginSession earlier, otherwise the runtime must: return error
ename:XR_ERROR_VALIDATION_FAILURE.

  represents the returned state.
* pname:active is an basetype:XrBool32 returns whether the secondary view
  configuration is active and displaying frames to users.
****

When a secondary view configuration becomes active, the application should:
render its secondary views as soon as possible, by getting their view
transforms and FOV using flink:xrLocateViews and then submitting composition
layers to flink:xrEndFrame through the
slink:XrSecondaryViewConfigurationFrameEndInfoMSFT extension structure.
When a secondary view configuration changes from inactive to active, the
runtime may: change slink:XrViewConfigurationView of the given view
configuration such as the recommended image width or height.
An application should: query for latest slink:XrViewConfigurationView
through flink:xrEnumerateViewConfigurationViews function for the secondary
view configuration and consider recreating swapchain images if necessary.
The runtime must: not change the slink:XrViewConfigurationView, including
recommended image width and height of a secondary view configuration when
pname:active remains true until the secondary view configuration deactivated
or the session has ended.

If necessary, the application can: take longer than a frame duration to
prepare by calling flink:xrEndFrame without submitting layers for that
secondary view configuration until ready.
The runtime should: delay the underlying scenario managed by the secondary
view configuration until the application begins submitting frames with
layers for that configuration.
The active secondary view configuration composed output is undefined if the
application stops submitting frames with layers for a secondary view
configuration while pname:active remains true.

When the runtime intends to conclude a secondary view configuration, for
example when user stops video capture, the runtime makes the view
configuration inactive by setting the corresponding pname:active in the
slink:XrSecondaryViewConfigurationStateMSFT structure to false.

include::../../../../generated/validity/structs/XrSecondaryViewConfigurationStateMSFT.txt[]
--

==== Locate and inspect view states of secondary view configurations

When the application calls flink:xrLocateViews, it can: use
slink:XrViewLocateInfo::viewConfigurationType field to query the view
locations and projections for any enabled elink:XrViewConfigurationType for
the running session.

The runtime must: return ename:XR_ERROR_VIEW_CONFIGURATION_TYPE_UNSUPPORTED
from flink:xrLocateViews if the specified elink:XrViewConfigurationType is
not enabled for the running session using
slink:XrSecondaryViewConfigurationSessionBeginInfoMSFT when calling
flink:xrBeginSession.

If the view configuration is supported but not active, as indicated in
slink:XrSecondaryViewConfigurationFrameStateMSFT, flink:xrLocateViews will
successfully return, but the resulting `XrViewState` may: have
ename:XR_VIEW_STATE_ORIENTATION_TRACKED_BIT and
ename:XR_VIEW_STATE_ORIENTATION_TRACKED_BIT unset.

==== Submit composition layers to secondary view configurations

[open,refpage='XrSecondaryViewConfigurationFrameEndInfoMSFT', desc='Submit an array of slink:XrSecondaryViewConfigurationLayerInfoMSFT, one for each secondary view configuration.', type='structs',xrefs='xrEndFrame XrSecondaryViewConfigurationLayerInfoMSFT']
--
The application should: submit layers each frame for all active secondary
view configurations using the flink:xrEndFrame function, by chaining the
slink:XrSecondaryViewConfigurationFrameEndInfoMSFT structure to the next
pointer of slink:XrFrameEndInfo structure.

The slink:XrSecondaryViewConfigurationFrameEndInfoMSFT structure is defined
as as:

include::../../../../generated/api/structs/XrSecondaryViewConfigurationFrameEndInfoMSFT.txt[]

.Member Descriptions
****
* pname:type is the elink:XrStructureType of this structure.
* pname:next is code:NULL or a pointer to the next structure in a structure
  chain.
  No such structures are defined in core OpenXR or this extension.
* pname:viewConfigurationCount is the number of elements in
  pname:viewConfigurationLayersInfo.
* pname:viewConfigurationLayersInfo is an array of
  slink:XrSecondaryViewConfigurationLayerInfoMSFT, containing composition
  layers to be submitted for the specified active view configuration.
****

The view configuration type in each
slink:XrSecondaryViewConfigurationLayerInfoMSFT must be one of the view
configurations enabled when calling flink:xrBeginSession in
slink:XrSecondaryViewConfigurationSessionBeginInfoMSFT, or else the runtime
must: return error
ename:XR_ERROR_SECONDARY_VIEW_CONFIGURATION_TYPE_NOT_ENABLED_MSFT.

The view configuration type in each
slink:XrSecondaryViewConfigurationLayerInfoMSFT must not be the primary view
configuration in this session, or else the runtime must: return error
ename:XR_ERROR_LAYER_INVALID.
The primary view configuration layers continue to be submitted through
slink:XrFrameEndInfo directly.

If the view configuration is not active, as indicated in
slink:XrSecondaryViewConfigurationFrameStateMSFT, the composition layers
submitted to this view configuration may: be ignored by the runtime.
Applications should: avoid rendering into secondary views when the view
configuration is inactive.

[open,refpage='XrSecondaryViewConfigurationLayerInfoMSFT', desc='Describe an array of composition layers to be submitted to given elink:XrViewConfigurationType.', type='structs',xrefs='xrEndFrame XrSecondaryViewConfigurationFrameEndInfoMSFT']
--
The application should submit an
slink:XrSecondaryViewConfigurationLayerInfoMSFT in
slink:XrSecondaryViewConfigurationFrameEndInfoMSFT for each active secondary
view configuration type when calling flink:xrEndFrame.

The slink:XrSecondaryViewConfigurationLayerInfoMSFT structure is defined as
as:

include::../../../../generated/api/structs/XrSecondaryViewConfigurationLayerInfoMSFT.txt[]

.Member Descriptions
****
* pname:type is the elink:XrStructureType of this structure.
* pname:next is code:NULL or a pointer to the next structure in a structure
  chain.
  No such structures are defined in core OpenXR or this extension.
* pname:viewConfigurationType is elink:XrViewConfigurationType to which the
  composition layers will be displayed.
* pname:environmentBlendMode is the elink:XrEnvironmentBlendMode value
  representing the desired <<environment_blend_mode, environment blend
  mode>> for this view configuration.
* pname:layerCount is the number of composition layers in this frame for the
  secondary view configuration type.
  The maximum supported layer count is identified by
  slink:XrSystemGraphicsProperties::maxLayerCount.
  If layerCount is greater than the maximum supported layer count then
  ename:XR_ERROR_LAYER_LIMIT_EXCEEDED is returned.
  The runtime must: support at least
  ename:XR_MIN_COMPOSITION_LAYERS_SUPPORTED layers.
* pname:layers is a pointer to an array of
  slink:XrCompositionLayerBaseHeader pointers.
****

This structure is similar to the slink:XrFrameEndInfo structure, with an
extra elink:XrViewConfigurationType field to specify the view configuration
for which the submitted layers will be rendered.

The application should: render its content for both the primary and
secondary view configurations using the same pname:predictedDisplayTime
reported by flink:xrWaitFrame.
The runtime must: treat both the primary views and secondary views as being
submitted for the same pname:displayTime specified in the call to
flink:xrEndFrame.

For layers such as quad layers whose content is identical across view
configurations, the application can: submit the same
slink:XrCompositionLayerBaseHeader structures to multiple view
configurations in the same flink:xrEndFrame function call.

For each frame, the application should: only render and submit layers for
the secondary view configurations that were active that frame, as indicated
in the slink:XrSecondaryViewConfigurationFrameStateMSFT filled in for that
frame's flink:xrWaitFrame call.
The runtime must: ignore composition layers submitted for an inactive view
configuration.
