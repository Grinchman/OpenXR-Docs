*Overview*

This extension enables the application to modify and query specific mutable
state associated with an Android surface swapchain, examples include:

* A video application may need to update the default size of the image
  buffers associated with an Android Surface Swapchain.
* A video application may need to communicate a new width and height for an
  Android Surface Swapchain, as the surface dimensions may be implicitly
  updated by the producer during the life of the Swapchain.
  This is important for correct application of the non-normalized
  pname:imageRect specified via slink:XrSwapchainSubImage.


In order to enable the functionality of this extension, the application
must: pass the name of the extension into flink:xrCreateInstance via the
slink:XrInstanceCreateInfo pname:enabledExtensionNames parameter as
indicated in the <<extensions>> section.

*New Object Types*

elink:XrStructureType enumeration is extended with:

The slink:XrSwapchainStateAndroidSurfaceDimensionsFB structure is defined
as:

include::../../../../generated/api/structs/XrSwapchainStateAndroidSurfaceDimensionsFB.txt[]

.Member Descriptions
****
* pname:type is the elink:XrStructureType of this structure.
* pname:next is code:NULL or a pointer to the next structure in a structure
  chain.
  No such structures are defined in core OpenXR or this extension.
* pname:width is the width of the image buffer, must not be greater than the
  graphics API's maximum limit.
* pname:height is the height of the image buffer, must not be greater than
  the graphics API's maximum limit.
****

When slink:XrSwapchainStateAndroidSurfaceDimensionsFB is specified in the
call to flink:xrUpdateSwapchainFB, the dimensions provided will be used to
update the default size of the image buffers associated with the Android
Surface swapchain.

Additionally, the dimensions provided will become the new source of truth
for the swapchain width and height, affecting operations such as computing
the normalized imageRect for the swapchain.

When slink:XrSwapchainStateAndroidSurfaceDimensionsFB is specified in the
call to flink:xrGetSwapchainStateFB, the dimensions will be populated with
the current swapchain width and height.

To use slink:XrSwapchainStateAndroidSurfaceDimensionsFB,
dlink:XR_USE_PLATFORM_ANDROID must be defined before including
`openxr_platform.h`.
