*Overview*

Passthrough is a way to show a user their physical environment in a
light-blocking VR headset.
Applications may use passthrough in a multitude of ways, including:

* Creating AR-like experiences, where virtual objects augment the user's
  environment.
* Bringing real objects into a VR experience.
* Mapping the playspace such that a VR experience is customized to it.

This extension allows:

* An application to request passthrough to be composited with the
  application content.
* An application to specify the compositing and blending rules between
  passthrough and VR content.
* An application to apply styles, such as color mapping and edge rendering,
  to passthrough.
* An application to provide a geometry to be used in place of the user's
  physical environment.
  Camera images will be projected onto the surface provided by the
  application.
  In some cases where a part of the environment, such as a desk, can be
  approximated well, this provides better visual experience.

transformation, with the semantics that a specific mesh will be instantiated
in a specific layer with a specific transformation.
A mesh can be instantiated multiple times, in the same or in different
layers.
