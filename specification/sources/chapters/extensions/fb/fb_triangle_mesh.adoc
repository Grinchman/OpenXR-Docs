*Overview*

Meshes may be useful in XR applications when representing parts of the
environment.
In particular, application may provide the surfaces of real-world objects
tagged manually to the runtime, or obtain automatically detected environment
contents.

This extension allows:

* An application to create a triangle mesh and specify the mesh data.
* An application to update mesh contents if a mesh is mutable.

In order to enable the functionality of this extension, the application
must: pass the name of the extension into flink:xrCreateInstance via the
slink:XrInstanceCreateInfo::pname:enabledExtensionNames parameter as
indicated in the <<extensions>> section.

*New Object Types*

[open,refpage='XrTriangleMeshFB',type='handles',desc='Triangle mesh']
--
include::{INCS-VAR}/api/handles/XrTriangleMeshFB.txt[]

slink:XrTriangleMeshFB represents a triangle mesh with its corresponding
mesh data: a vertex buffer and an index buffer.
--

*New Flag Types*

*New Enum Constants*

elink:XrStructureType enumeration is extended with:

* ename:XR_TYPE_TRIANGLE_MESH_CREATE_INFO_FB

*New Enums*

[open,refpage='XrWindingOrderFB',desc='Triangle winding order',type='enums']
--
Applications may specify the triangle winding order of a mesh - whether the
vertices of an outward-facing side of a triangle appear in clockwise or
counter-clockwise order - using elink:XrWindingOrderFB enumeration.

include::../../../../generated/api/enums/XrWindingOrderFB.txt[]

*New Structures*

[open,refpage='XrTriangleMeshCreateInfoFB',type='structs',desc='The information to create a triangle mesh',xrefs='']
--

slink:XrTriangleMeshCreateInfoFB must: be provided when calling
flink:xrCreateTriangleMeshFB.

The slink:XrTriangleMeshCreateInfoFB structure is defined as:

include::{INCS-VAR}/api/structs/XrTriangleMeshCreateInfoFB.txt[]

.Member Descriptions
****
* pname:type is the elink:XrStructureType of this structure.
* pname:next is code:NULL or a pointer to the next structure in a structure
  chain.
  No such structures are defined in core OpenXR or this extension.
* pname:flags is a bitmask of elink:XrTriangleMeshFlagBitsFB that specify
  behavior.
* pname:windingOrder is the elink:XrWindingOrderFB value defining the
  winding order of the mesh triangles.
* pname:vertexCount is the number of vertices in the mesh.
  In the case of the mutable mesh, the value is treated as the maximum
  number of vertices the mesh will be able to represent at any time in its
  lifecycle.
  The actual number of vertices can vary and is defined when
  flink:xrTriangleMeshEndUpdateFB is called.
* pname:vertexBuffer is a pointer to the vertex data.
  The size of the array must be pname:vertexCount elements.
  When the mesh is mutable (`(pname:flags &
  ename:XR_TRIANGLE_MESH_MUTABLE_BIT_FB) != 0`), the pname:vertexBuffer
  parameter must: be code:NULL and mesh data must: be populated separately.
* pname:triangleCount is the number of triangles in the mesh.
  In the case of the mutable mesh, the value is treated as the maximum
  number of triangles the mesh will be able to represent at any time in its
  lifecycle.
  The actual number of triangles can vary and is defined when
  flink:xrTriangleMeshEndUpdateFB is called.
* pname:indexBuffer the triangle indices.
  The size of the array must be pname:triangleCount elements.
  When the mesh is mutable (`(pname:flags &
  ename:XR_TRIANGLE_MESH_MUTABLE_BIT_FB) != 0`), the pname:indexBuffer
  parameter must: be code:NULL and mesh data must: be populated separately.
****

Mesh buffers can be updated between flink:xrTriangleMeshBeginUpdateFB and
flink:xrTriangleMeshEndUpdateFB calls.

*New Functions*

[open,refpage='xrCreateTriangleMeshFB',desc='Create a triangle mesh',type='protos',xrefs='XrTriangleMeshFB XrTriangleMeshCreateInfoFB']
--
The flink:xrCreateTriangleMeshFB function is defined as:

include::{INCS-VAR}/api/protos/xrCreateTriangleMeshFB.txt[]

.Parameter Descriptions
****
* pname:session is the slink:XrSession to which the mesh will belong.
* pname:createInfo is a pointer to an slink:XrTriangleMeshCreateInfoFB
  structure containing parameters to be used to create the mesh.
* pname:outTriangleMesh is a pointer to a handle in which the created
  slink:XrTriangleMeshFB is returned.
****

This creates an slink:XrTriangleMeshFB handle.
The returned triangle mesh handle may: be subsequently used in API calls.

include::{INCS-VAR}/validity/protos/xrCreateTriangleMeshFB.txt[]
--

[open,refpage='xrDestroyTriangleMeshFB',desc='Destroy a triangle mesh',type='protos',xrefs='XrTriangleMeshFB']
--
The flink:xrDestroyTriangleMeshFB function is defined as:

include::{INCS-VAR}/api/protos/xrDestroyTriangleMeshFB.txt[]

.Parameter Descriptions
****
* pname:mesh is the slink:XrTriangleMeshFB to destroy.
****

slink:XrTriangleMeshFB handles and their associated data are destroyed by
flink:xrDestroyTriangleMeshFB.
The mesh buffers retrieved by flink:xrTriangleMeshGetVertexBufferFB and
flink:xrTriangleMeshGetIndexBufferFB must: not be accessed anymore after
their parent mesh object has been destroyed.

include::{INCS-VAR}/validity/protos/xrDestroyTriangleMeshFB.txt[]
--

[open,refpage='xrTriangleMeshGetVertexBufferFB',desc='Obtain the vertex buffer of a triangle mesh',type='protos',xrefs='']
--
The flink:xrTriangleMeshGetVertexBufferFB function is defined as:

include::{INCS-VAR}/api/protos/xrTriangleMeshGetVertexBufferFB.txt[]

.Parameter Descriptions
****
* pname:mesh is the slink:XrTriangleMeshFB to get the vertex buffer for.
* pname:outVertexBuffer is a pointer to return the vertex buffer into.
****

Retrieves a pointer to the vertex buffer.
The vertex buffer is structured as an array of slink:XrVector3f.
The size of the buffer is pname:vertexCount.
The application must call flink:xrTriangleMeshBeginUpdateFB or
flink:xrTriangleMeshBeginVertexBufferUpdateFB before making modifications to
the vertex buffer.
The buffer location is guaranteed to remain constant over the lifecycle of
the mesh object.

include::{INCS-VAR}/validity/protos/xrTriangleMeshGetVertexBufferFB.txt[]
--

[open,refpage='xrTriangleMeshGetIndexBufferFB',desc='Obtain the index buffer of a triangle mesh',type='protos',xrefs='']
--
The flink:xrTriangleMeshGetIndexBufferFB function is defined as:

include::{INCS-VAR}/api/protos/xrTriangleMeshGetIndexBufferFB.txt[]

.Parameter Descriptions
****
* pname:mesh is the slink:XrTriangleMeshFB to get the index buffer for.
* pname:outIndexBuffer is a pointer to return the index buffer into.
****

Retrieves a pointer to the index buffer that defines the topology of the
triangle mesh.
Each triplet of consecutive elements points to three vertices in the vertex
buffer and thus form a triangle.

The application must: call flink:xrTriangleMeshBeginUpdateFB before making
modifications to the index buffer.
The buffer location is guaranteed to remain constant over the lifecycle of
the mesh object.

include::{INCS-VAR}/validity/protos/xrTriangleMeshGetIndexBufferFB.txt[]

include::{INCS-VAR}/api/protos/xrTriangleMeshBeginUpdateFB.txt[]

.Parameter Descriptions
****
* pname:mesh is the slink:XrTriangleMeshFB to update.
****

Begins updating the mesh buffer data.
The application must: call this function before it makes any modifications
to the buffers retrieved by flink:xrTriangleMeshGetVertexBufferFB and
flink:xrTriangleMeshGetIndexBufferFB.
If only the vertex buffer needs to be updated,
flink:xrTriangleMeshBeginVertexBufferUpdateFB may: be used instead.
To commit the modifications, the application must: call
flink:xrTriangleMeshEndUpdateFB.
Runtime must: return ename:XR_ERROR_VALIDATION_FAILURE if the mesh is
immutable.

include::{INCS-VAR}/validity/protos/xrTriangleMeshBeginUpdateFB.txt[]

The flink:xrTriangleMeshEndUpdateFB function is defined as:

include::{INCS-VAR}/api/protos/xrTriangleMeshEndUpdateFB.txt[]

.Parameter Descriptions
****
* pname:mesh is the slink:XrTriangleMeshFB to update.
* pname:vertexCount is the vertex count after the update.
* pname:triangleCount is the triangle count after the update.
****

Signals to the runtime that the application has finished updating the mesh
buffers following a call to flink:xrTriangleMeshBeginUpdateFB.
pname:vertexCount and pname:triangleCount specify the actual number of
primitives that make up the mesh after the update.
They must be larger than zero but smaller or equal to the maximum counts
defined at create time.

* pname:outVertexCount is the current vertex count.
  The updated data must have the exact same number of vertices.
****

Begins an update of the vertex positions of a triangle mesh.
Can only be called once the mesh topology has been set using
flink:xrTriangleMeshBeginUpdateFB followed by
flink:xrTriangleMeshEndUpdateFB.
The vertex count is defined by the last invocation to
flink:xrTriangleMeshEndUpdateFB.
Once the modification is done, call
flink:xrTriangleMeshEndVertexBufferUpdateFB to commit the changes.
Runtime must: return ename:XR_ERROR_VALIDATION_FAILURE if an invalid count
is passed.
