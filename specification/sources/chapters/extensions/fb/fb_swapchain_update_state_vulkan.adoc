*Overview*

This extension enables the application to modify and query Vulkan-specific
mutable state associated with a swapchain, examples include:

* On platforms where composition runs in a separate process from the
  application, swapchains must be created in a cross-process friendly way.
  In such cases, the texture image memory may be shared between processes,
  but the texture state may not; and, an explicit mechanism to synchronize
  this texture state between the application and the compositor is required.

In order to enable the functionality of this extension, the application
must: pass the name of the extension into flink:xrCreateInstance via the
slink:XrInstanceCreateInfo pname:enabledExtensionNames parameter as
indicated in the <<extensions>> section.

The slink:XrSwapchainStateSamplerVulkanFB structure is defined as:

include::{INCS-VAR}/api/structs/XrSwapchainStateSamplerVulkanFB.txt[]

.Member Descriptions
****
* pname:type is the elink:XrStructureType of this structure.
* pname:next is code:NULL or a pointer to the next structure in a structure
  chain.
  No such structures are defined in core OpenXR or this extension.
* pname:minFilter is a valid Vulkan sname:VkFilter.
* pname:magFilter is a valid Vulkan sname:VkFilter.
* pname:mipmapMode is a valid Vulkan sname:VkSamplerMipmapMode.
* pname:wrapModeS is a valid Vulkan sname:VkSamplerAddressMode.
* pname:wrapModeT is a valid Vulkan sname:VkSamplerAddressMode.
* pname:swizzleRed is a valid Vulkan sname:VkComponentSwizzle.
* pname:swizzleGreen is a valid Vulkan sname:VkComponentSwizzle.
* pname:swizzleBlue is a valid Vulkan sname:VkComponentSwizzle.
* pname:swizzleAlpha is a valid Vulkan sname:VkComponentSwizzle.
* pname:maxAnisotropy is a valid float used to represent max anisotropy.
* pname:borderColor is an RGBA color to be used as border texels.

When slink:XrSwapchainStateSamplerVulkanFB is specified in the call to
flink:xrUpdateSwapchainFB, texture sampler state for all images in the
slink:XrSwapchain will be updated for the compositor process.
For most cases, the sampler state update is only required compositor-side,
as that is where the swapchain images are sampled.
If the application requires sampling of the swapchain images, the
application will be responsible for updating the texture state using normal
Vulkan mechanisms and synchronizing appropriately with application-side
rendering.

When slink:XrSwapchainStateSamplerVulkanFB is specified in the call to
flink:xrGetSwapchainStateFB, the sampler state will be populated with the
current swapchain sampler state.

To use slink:XrSwapchainStateSamplerVulkanFB,
dlink:XR_USE_GRAPHICS_API_VULKAN must be defined before including
`openxr_platform.h`.
