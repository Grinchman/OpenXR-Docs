*Overview*

Foveation in the context of XR is a rendering technique that allows the area
of an image near the focal point or fovea of the eye to be displayed at
higher resolution than areas in the periphery.
This trades some visual fidelity in the periphery, where it is less
noticeable for the user, for improved rendering performance, most notably
regarding the fragment shader, as fewer pixels or subpixels in the periphery
need to be shaded and processed.
On platforms which support foveation patterns and features tailored towards
the optical properties, performance profiles, and hardware support of
specific HMDs, application developers may request and use available
foveation profiles from the runtime.
Foveation profiles refer to a set of properties describing how, when, and
where foveation will be applied.

This extension allows:

* An application to create swapchains that can support foveation for its
  graphics API.
* An application to request foveation profiles supported by the runtime and
  apply them to foveation-supported swapchains.

In order to enable the functionality of this extension, you must: pass the
name of the extension into flink:xrCreateInstance via the
slink:XrInstanceCreateInfo pname:enabledExtensionNames parameter as
indicated in the <<extensions>> section.

*New Structures*

[open,refpage='XrFoveationProfileCreateInfoFB',type='structs',desc='The information to create a foveation profile',xrefs='XrSwapchainCreateFoveationFlagBitsFB']
--

slink:XrFoveationProfileCreateInfoFB must: be provided when calling
flink:xrCreateFoveationProfileFB.
The runtime must: interpret slink:XrFoveationProfileCreateInfoFB without any
additional structs in its pname:next chain as a request to create a
foveation profile that will apply no foveation to any area of the swapchain.

The slink:XrFoveationProfileCreateInfoFB structure is defined as:

include::{INCS-VAR}/api/structs/XrFoveationProfileCreateInfoFB.txt[]

.Member Descriptions
****
* pname:type is the elink:XrStructureType of this structure.
* pname:next is code:NULL or a pointer to the next structure in a structure
  chain.
  No such structures are defined in core OpenXR or this extension.
****

[open,refpage='XrSwapchainCreateInfoFoveationFB',type='structs',desc='The information to create a swapchain supporting foveation',xrefs='']
--

slink:XrSwapchainCreateInfoFoveationFB can: be provided in the pname:next
chain of slink:XrSwapchainCreateInfo when calling flink:xrCreateSwapchain to
indicate to the runtime that the swapchain must: be created with foveation
support in the corresponding graphics API.
slink:XrSwapchainCreateInfoFoveationFB contains additional
foveation-specific flags for swapchain creation.

The slink:XrSwapchainCreateInfoFoveationFB structure is defined as:

include::{INCS-VAR}/api/structs/XrSwapchainCreateInfoFoveationFB.txt[]

.Member Descriptions
****
* pname:type is the elink:XrStructureType of this structure.
* pname:next is code:NULL or a pointer to the next structure in a structure
  chain.
  No such structures are defined in core OpenXR or this extension.
* pname:flags is a bitmask of elink:XrSwapchainCreateFoveationFlagBitsFB
  which indicate various characteristics for how foveation is enabled on the
  swapchain.

slink:XrSwapchainStateFoveationFB can: be provided in place of
slink:XrSwapchainStateBaseHeaderFB when calling flink:xrUpdateSwapchainFB to
update the foveation properties of the swapchain.
slink:XrSwapchainCreateInfoFoveationFB contains the desired foveation
profile and additional foveation specific flags for updating the swapchain.

The slink:XrSwapchainStateFoveationFB structure is defined as:

include::{INCS-VAR}/api/structs/XrSwapchainStateFoveationFB.txt[]

.Member Descriptions
****
* pname:type is the elink:XrStructureType of this structure.
* pname:next is code:NULL or a pointer to the next structure in a structure
  chain.
  No such structures are defined in core OpenXR or this extension.
* pname:flags is a bitmask of elink:XrSwapchainStateFoveationFlagBitsFB
  which indicate various characteristics of how and when the foveation
  properties of the swapchain must: be updated.
* pname:profile is an slink:XrFoveationProfileFB defining the desired
  foveation properties to be applied to the swapchain.

include::{INCS-VAR}/api/protos/xrCreateFoveationProfileFB.txt[]

.Parameter Descriptions
****
* pname:session is the slink:XrSession that created the swapchains to which
  this foveation profile will be applied.
* pname:createInfo is a pointer to an slink:XrFoveationProfileCreateInfoFB
  structure containing parameters to be used to create the foveation
  profile.
* pname:profile is a pointer to a handle in which the created
  slink:XrFoveationProfileFB is returned.
****

Creates an slink:XrFoveationProfileFB handle.
The returned foveation profile handle may: be subsequently used in API
calls.

The flink:xrDestroyFoveationProfileFB function is defined as:

include::{INCS-VAR}/api/protos/xrDestroyFoveationProfileFB.txt[]

.Parameter Descriptions
****
* pname:profile is the slink:XrFoveationProfileFB to destroy.
****

slink:XrFoveationProfileFB handles are destroyed using
flink:xrDestroyFoveationProfileFB.
A slink:XrFoveationProfileFB may: be safely destroyed after being applied to
a swapchain state using flink:xrUpdateSwapchainFB without affecting the
foveation parameters of the swapchain.
The application is responsible for ensuring that it has no calls using
profile in progress when the foveation profile is destroyed.
