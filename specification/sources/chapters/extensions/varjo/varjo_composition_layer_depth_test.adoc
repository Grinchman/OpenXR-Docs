*Overview*

This extension enables depth-based layer composition inside the compositor.

Core OpenXR specifies that layer compositing must happen in the layer
submission order (as described in <<Compositing>>).
However, an application may want to composite the final image against the
other layers based on depth information for proper occlusion.
Layers can now provide depth information that will be used to calculate
occlusion between those layers, as well as with the environment depth
estimator (`<<XR_VARJO_environment_depth_estimation>>`) when enabled.

This extension defines a new type, slink:XrCompositionLayerDepthTestVARJO,
which can be chained to slink:XrCompositionLayerProjection in order to
activate this functionality.
An application must also specify a range where depth testing will happen,
potentially covering only a subset of the full depth range.

*Composition*

Layer composition rules change when this extension is enabled.

If the application does not chain slink:XrCompositionLayerDepthTestVARJO,
"painter's algorithm" such as described in <<Compositing>> must be used for
layer composition.

Overall, composition should be performed in the following way:

 1. Layers must be composited in the submission order.
    The compositor must track the depth value nearest to the virtual camera.
    Initial value for the nearest depth should be infinity.
 2. If the currently processed layer does not contain depth, compositor
    should composite the layer against the previous layers with "painter's
    algorithm" and move to the next layer.
 3. If the layer depth or the active nearest depth fall inside the depth
    test range of the layer, the compositor must perform depth test against
    the layer and active depth.
    If the layer depth is less or equal than the active depth, layer is
    composited normally with the previous layers and active depth is updated
    to match the layer depth.
    Otherwise the layer pixel is discarded, and compositor should move to
    composite the next layer.

*Example*

Mixed reality applications may want to show hands on top of the rendered VR
content.
For this purpose the application should enable environment depth estimation
(see `<<XR_VARJO_environment_depth_estimation>>` extension) and depth
testing with range 0m to 1m.

The following code illustrates how to enable depth testing:

[source,c++]
----
XrCompositionLayerProjection layer; // previously populated

XrCompositionLayerDepthTestVARJO depthTest{XR_TYPE_COMPOSITION_LAYER_DEPTH_TEST_VARJO, layer.next};
depthTest.depthTestRangeNearZ = 0.0f; // in meters
depthTest.depthTestRangeFarZ = 1.0f; // in meters
layer.next = &depthTest;
----

*New Structures*

[open,refpage='XrCompositionLayerDepthTestVARJO',type='structs',desc='The structure to be passed when submitting layers to enable depth testing',xrefs='xrEndFrame']
--

Applications can: enable depth testing by adding
slink:XrCompositionLayerDepthTestVARJO to the pname:next chain for all
slink:XrCompositionLayerProjectionView structures in the given layer in
addition to slink:XrCompositionLayerDepthInfoKHR.
Missing slink:XrCompositionLayerDepthInfoKHR automatically disables the
depth testing functionality.

The slink:XrCompositionLayerDepthTestVARJO structure is defined as:

include::../../../../generated/api/structs/XrCompositionLayerDepthTestVARJO.txt[]

.Member Descriptions
****
* pname:type is the elink:XrStructureType of this structure.
* pname:next is code:NULL or a pointer to the next structure in a structure
  chain.
  No such structures are defined in core OpenXR or this extension.
* pname:depthTestRangeNearZ in a non-negative distance in meters that
  specifies the lower bound of the range where depth testing should be
  performed.
  Must be less than pname:depthTestRangeFarZ.
  Value of zero means that there is no lower bound.
* pname:depthTestRangeFarZ is a positive distance in meters that specifies
  the upper bound of the range where depth testing should be performed.
  Must be greater than pname:depthTestRangeNearZ.
  Value of floating point positive infinity means that there is no upper
  bound.
